# MongoDB

## Prerequisites
 - Start the mongoDB server using the command `mongod` in the terminal
 - Start the mongoDB interactive shell using the command `mongo` on a separate terminal.

> **NOTE** : Sometimes the mongod server is already running in the background in _ubuntu_. So first just try running the command mentioned in the second step i.e. `mongo`. If it doesn't work then start the server and the interactive shell, one after another respectively.

After successfully entering the interactive shell try out the following stuff :

## <ins>CREATE</ins>

### Creating a database
 - To create a database enter the command `use db_name` where _db_name_ is the name of the database you want to create.
 - This command is also used to switch between databases
 - Eg:-
    ```js
    use cars
    ```

### List databases
 - To view the various databases created enter :-
    ```js
    show dbs
    ```
 - Result:
    ```
    admin   0.000GB
    config  0.000GB
    local   0.000GB
    temp    0.000GB
    ```
> **NOTE** : The _cars_ db created in the earlier command isn't visible as it has no data in it. Once a [collection](#creating-collections) is created it will be visible on executing the above command.
 - To view the database you are currently using enter:-
    ```js
    db
    ```

### Creating collections
 - Collections are in `mongoDB` what tables are in `SQL`.
 - The only difference is that you don't need to have a defined structure of the _column names_ and the _datatype_ those columns will have in `mongoDB` unlike `SQL`.
 - You can directly create a collection without specifying any details of the data that will be entered in it.
 - This can be done using the command `db.createCollection('collection_name')`
 - Eg:-
    ```js
    db.createCollection('car_details')
    ```


### Inserting documents
 - In `mongoDB` when you make an entry in a collection that entry is called a _document_ i.e. a _row_ in terms of `SQL`
 - You can insert a document in a collection using the command `db.collection_name.insert(data)`
 - Structure of the data in the example below :-
    - brand
    - model_name
    - type
    - engine
        - fuel
        - cc
        - bhp
    - color
    - safety
        - airbag (if airbags isn't present then this field is omitted else its type(i.e. airbag type, for eg:- front/front and rear) is associated with the _key_)
        - sb_warn (seatbelt warning)
 - Eg:-
    ```js
    db.car_details.insert(
        {
            'brand': 'chevrolet',
            'model_name': 'beat',
            'type': 'hatchback',
            'engine': {
                'fuel': 'petrol',
                'cc': 1000,
                'bhp': 100
            },
            'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green'],
            'safety': {
                'sb_warn': false
            },
            'price' : 400000
        }
    )
    ```
 - You can insert multiple entries in one go by using an array of objects i.e.
    ```js
    db.collection_name.insert([{},{},....])
    ```
 - Copy and paste the contents of [this](insert.js) file in your terminal.
   - The file contains an array of objects containing the car_details.

---

## <ins>READ</ins>

 - Fetching data from the documents is done using the `find()` function.
 - Eg:- 
    ```
    db.car_details.find()
    ```
 - This returns all the documents in the _car_details_ collection as **no** parameter was passed as to which filter(s) should be applied.

- To get a readable format of the results use the `pretty()` function
- Eg: -
    ```js
    db.car_details.find().pretty()
    ```
- This returns a properly formatted result of the `find()` output.

### Filters

 - To get the document(s) based on some filters enter the _key_ and the corresponding _value_ as the first parameter to the `find()` function.
 - Eg:- 
 - Here we want to get the details of the cars of type **sedan**
    ```js
    db.car_details.find({ 'type' : 'sedan' }).pretty()
    ```
 - You could relate this type of filtering to the _WHERE_ clause in `SQL`.

### Comparison Operators

  - Comparison operators can be used to filter documents in monogDB using the following specifiers:-
    -  **$gt** = greater than
    -  **$gte** = greater than equal to
    -  **$lt** = less than
    -  **$lte** = less than equal to
    -  **$ne** = not equal to
  - Eg:- (**$lte**)
    ```js
    db.car_details.find({
        'price' : { '$lte' : 500000 }
    }).pretty()
    ```

### Logical Operators

 - Logical operators can be used to filter documents in mongoDB using the following specifications:-
   - **$or** = OR operation
   - **$and** = AND operation

 - Eg:- (AND)
    ```js
    db.car_details.find({'$and' : [
        { 'type' : 'sedan' },
        { 'price' : { '$gte' : 500000 } }
    ]}).pretty()
    ```
    > Notice that the following command will also output the same result as the previous, this is because the default operation in case of multiple filters is an _AND_ operation.
 - Eg:- (AND)(without the **$and** specifier)
    ```js
    db.car_details.find({
         'type' : 'sedan' ,
         'price' : { '$gte' : 500000 }
    }).pretty()
    ```
 - Eg:- (OR)
    ```js
    db.car_details.find({'$or': [
        { 'type' : 'sedan' },
        { 'price' : { '$gte' : 500000 } }
    ]}).pretty()
    ```

### Functions

 - **sort()**
    - Sort function can be used to sort the result of the query based on a key
    - For ascending set the value of the key to 1
    and for descending set it to -1
    - Eg:- SORT (desc)
        ```js
        db.car_details.find().sort(
            {'price' : -1}
        ).pretty()
        ```

 - **limit()**
    - To limit the no. of results of the query, send the no of results to be displayed as a parameter to the limit function
    - Eg:-
        ```js
        db.car_details.find().limit(3).pretty()
        ```

 - **count()**
    - To just display the no of results that the query will output the `count()` function can be used
    - Eg:-
        ```js
        db.car_details.find().count()
        ```

### Miscellaneous

 - **$exists**
   - To check whether a key exists in the documents in the collections the $exists specifier
   - Eg:-
        ```js
        db.car_details.find({
            'safety.airbags': {'$exists' : true}
        }).pretty()
        ```

 - **$regex**
   - Regular expressions can also be used to find entries having a pattern using the $regex specifier
   - Eg:-
        ```js
        db.car_details.find({
            'model_name' : { $regex: /^e/ }
        }).pretty()

        ```

## <ins>UPDATE</ins>

 - There are 3 functions associated to updation of documents in mongoDB :-
   - **updateOne()**
     - This method is used to update the first matching document based on the filters provided
     - Eg:-
       ```js
       db.car_details.updateOne(
           { 'model_name' : 'cruze' },
           { '$set' : { 'price' : 1500000 } }
       )
       ```

   - **updateMany()**
     - This method is used to update all the matching documents based on the filters provided
     - Eg:-
       ```js
       db.car_details.updateMany(
           { },
           { '$rename' : { 'body_type' : 'type' } }
       )
       ```
   - **replaceOne()**
     - This method is used to update the first matching document based on the filters provided
     - Eg:-
       ```js
       db.car_details.replaceOne(
         { 'model_name' : 'jazz' },
         {
             'brand': 'honda',
             'model_name': 'jazz',
             'type': 'hatchback',
             'engine': {
                 'fuel': 'diesel',
                 'cc': 1150,
                 'bhp': 115
             },
             'color': ['silver','orange','white'],
             'safety': {
                 'airbags' : 'front',
                 'sb_warn': true
             },
             'price' : 750000
         }
       )
       ```

---
 
## <ins>DELETE</ins>

### Deleting documents
 - One or many documents can be deleted in mongoDb using the following commands:-
   - **deleteOne()**
     - This method deletes the first document that matches the conditions specified
     - Eg:-
       ```js
       db.car_details.deleteOne(
              { 'model_name' : 'city' }
       )
       ```

   - **deleteMany()**
     - This method deletes the all the documents that match the conditions specified. If no condition is specified then all documents in the collection are deleted.
   
     - Eg:-
       ```js
       db.car_details.deleteMany(
              { 'body_type' : 'suv' }
       )
       ```

### Deleting collections
 - To delete a collection enter `db.collection_name.drop()`
 - Eg:-
   ```js
   db.car_details.drop()
   ```

### Deleting databases

 - To delete the database you are currently working on, enter :-
   ```js
   db.dropDatabase()
   ```
